🚀 Summary of Progress & Next Steps for Full-Scale Expansion

🔍 What We Didd

We successfully built and tested an LLM-based benchmark pipeline for evaluating distractor effects on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) using the RACE dataset. The key steps:

✅ 1. Multi-Prompt Distractor Generation (multi_prompt.py)
	•	Extracted reading comprehension MCQs from RACE.
	•	Generated weak & moderate distractors using GPT-4o-mini.
	•	Saved distractor sets separately for controlled experiments.

✅ 2. METEOR Score Computation (score_tracker.py)
	•	Compared generated distractors with expert ones using METEOR.
	•	Stored computed scores in meteor_scores.json.

✅ 3. LLM Performance Evaluation (test.py)
	•	Queried an LLM to answer questions with different distractor sets.
	•	Checked if the LLM chose the correct answer.
	•	Recorded accuracy in llm_evaluation.json.

✅ 4. Data Analysis & Trends (data_analysis.py)
	•	Analyzed accuracy fluctuations across weak & moderate distractor sets.
	•	Checked METEOR correlation with model performance.
	•	Visualized trends using bar & line charts.

🛠️ Debugging Fixes
	•	Ensured correct distractor-to-question alignment.
	•	Normalized METEOR scoring for fair comparison.
	•	Fixed issues with identical scores across sets.

📈 What’s Next? (Scaling Up to Full Benchmark)

We built a working prototype—now we expand it into a full-scale benchmark:

🔹 Step 1: Increase Dataset Size
	•	Expand from 10 to thousands of MCQs.
	•	Include both high & middle school RACE datasets:

dataset = load_dataset("race", "all")  # Instead of just 'high'


	•	Store datasets in batches to avoid memory overload.

🔹 Step 2: Enhance Distractor Generation
	•	Improve multi-prompt diversity:
	•	Weak distractors → More extreme logical fallacies.
	•	Moderate distractors → Ensure subtle but incorrect reasoning.
	•	Increase the number of distractors per question (e.g., 5 instead of 3).
	•	Experiment with different LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Mistral, Claude).

🔹 Step 3: Full LLM Performance Testing
	•	Test with multiple LLMs (not just GPT-4o-mini).
	•	Use APIs from DeepInfra/OpenAI to select models.
	•	Measure response confidence in addition to accuracy.

🔹 Step 4: Advanced Evaluation Metrics
	•	Beyond METEOR, add more NLP metrics:
	•	BLEU (n-gram precision).
	•	ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence overlap).
	•	BERTScore (semantic similarity).
	•	Cross-check whether METEOR strongly correlates with accuracy.

🔹 Step 5: Large-Scale Data Analysis
	•	Compare LLM performance trends across difficulty levels.
	•	Analyze which distractors confuse LLMs the most.
	•	Test human vs. LLM accuracy on the same distractor sets.

📌 Final Goal: A Robust LLM Benchmark

By following these steps, we create a scalable, reusable benchmark:
	•	Thousands of MCQs with generated distractor sets.
	•	Multiple LLMs evaluated under different difficulty conditions.
	•	Comprehensive analysis to detect model weaknesses.

🚀 Next Immediate Steps
	1.	Expand multi_prompt.py to process more data.
	2.	Improve distractor quality with better multi-stage prompts.
	3.	Re-run score_tracker.py & data_analysis.py on larger data.
	4.	Start integrating multiple LLMs via API switching.
	5.  MMLU-law SAT
	6.  SpaCy,
